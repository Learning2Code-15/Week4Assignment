This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset:-https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

Files:

R script called run_analysis.R that does the below 5 steps to convert provided raw data to tidy data:-

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyDataSet.txt -Tidy data  which has the exported data after processing through above steps
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
